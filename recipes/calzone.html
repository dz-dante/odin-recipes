	<p>Italian Calzones made using the original method.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
		<li>1 cup warm water</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
		<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
		<li>1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 cup diced pepperoni</li>
		<li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.</li>
		<li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
		<li>Punch down dough; divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling.</li>
		<li>Fold dough over filling to make a semicircle. Press edges down with the tines of a fork to seal. Brush the top of each calzone with beaten egg and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
